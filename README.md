# Localization-Any-Anomaly
Localization Any Anomaly, a model designed to detect anomalies in images, precisely identify their locations, and restore abnormal images to normal using zero-shot segmentation and inpainting techniques. It compares the differences between abnormal and normal images to accurately identify the boundaries and locations of anomalies.
